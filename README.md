# MuteTests
Tableau extension to mute/unmute test results
This was a hackathon project - don't judge the UI! :)
For details see https://www.tableau.com/developer/extensions

# Using the Extension
1.	Open a Tableau dashboard that shows test results
2.	From the side pane, add a new Extension object to the dashboard
3.	In the file picker, browse to the manifest file from this project (MuteTestsManifest.trex)
4.  Enter a bug number in the text field
5.	In the viz, select one or more test results, then click the corresponding button to mute or unmute the test cases associated with them, or to analyze the results
